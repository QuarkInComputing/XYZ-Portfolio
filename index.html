                    Hi, I'm Jack - but I'm sure you might have guessed that already.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a 19 year old <b>BSc Computer Science</b> student from <b>UHI Inverness</b>. I have previously been awarded my <b>HNC</b> and <b>HND</b> at UHI Inverness in Computer Science
                    both with an <b>A grade</b>. During my time at UHI Inverness I have cultivated a particular expertise in web & software development, being able to merge my existing 
                    design and programming skills into one.
                    <br>
                    I'm currently on the lookout for next steps after I leave higher education (expected mid 2026.)
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of my education you can find me working on my own <a href="#">personal projects</a>, and when I need to take some time to relax you'll catch me reading
                    science fiction or watching Star Trek.
                    <br><br>
                    It is a personal mission of mine to make tech as accessible to as many people as possible. Technology has helped me greatly during my lifetime not only as a deep interest
                    but as a tool used to aid me in day to day life. If in my lifetime I can benefit peoples life thanks to something I helped create then I will feel truly fulfilled.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Thanks for reading!</b>
